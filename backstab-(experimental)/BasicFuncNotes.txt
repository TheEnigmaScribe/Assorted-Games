To Do List
	- set a default map size to use for loading maps later
	- Figure out how to spawn enemies with text files
		- presumably achievable via a similar method to the pygame tutorial video?
		- might or might not include maps, since those can be loaded with scenes probably
		- necessary for giving invidividual enemies unique behaviors
		- if I end up doing the enemy text files, likely worth adding tilemap text files as well
	- Implement actual "game over" functionality for enemies
	- add player stab functionality
	- Create enemy movement function
	- Implement enemy turning/movement code
	- game menus
	- level selection
