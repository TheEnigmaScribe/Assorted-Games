To Do List
	- add actual "game over" functionality for enemies detecting the player
	- add player stab functionality
	- add player reaching goal functionality
	- game menus
		- main menu
		- settings (volume, zoom? idk yet)
		- level selection/player
		- quit button
	- basic sfx and music for game?
	- possibly load tilemaps with text files since I'm loading entities and enemy instructions that way already
	- probably have a second layer of folders in MapFiles, seperating each set of files by level
	- Fix minor input lag with movement keys based on comments under tilemap movement tutorial
	- add either a bounce or player priority if a player and enemy move into the same space at the same time
		- automatic detection guaranteed one way or another
		- likely feaasible through somehow communicating to enemies what the target tile of the player is
		- and then comparing it with the target tile of the enemy
	- CLEANUP
		- Reorganize with classes?
		- Remove pointless code and text in all files
		- Properly comment out code
