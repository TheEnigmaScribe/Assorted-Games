To Do List
	- work on making saves (and possibly achievements)
	- get started on the textboxes (with sprites) after enemies can kill the player and the player can complete the level
	- finish up menus
		- campaign menu
			- later save all following information to a file
			- start/continue button
				- if it's a new save (or possible on the Cell 82 scene? or its equivalent) have it display start
				- if it's not a new save, have it display continue
			- information
				- current level
				- how much time played
				- how many times you've died
				- how many times you've killed
			- managing save menu
				- delete/reset save file
					- are you sure? text
					- yes button
					- no button
				- back button
		- level selection (can't yet click and load a level')
		- settings
			- audio should eventually show sound settings
			- visuals should eventually show resolution fullscreen/not fullscreen settings and the like
			- controls should show control scheme and later allow for changing of keybinds
	- add actual "game over" functionality for enemies detecting the player
	- add player stab functionality
	- add player reaching goal functionality
	- game menus
		- main menu
		- settings (volume, zoom? idk yet)
		- level selection/player
		- quit button
	- basic sfx and music for game?
	- possibly load tilemaps with text files since I'm loading entities and enemy instructions that way already
	- probably have a second layer of folders in MapFiles, seperating each set of files by level
	- Fix minor input lag with movement keys based on comments under tilemap movement tutorial
	- add either a bounce or player priority if a player and enemy move into the same space at the same time
		- automatic detection guaranteed one way or another
		- likely feaasible through somehow communicating to enemies what the target tile of the player is
		- and then comparing it with the target tile of the enemy
	- CLEANUP
		- Reorganize with classes?
		- Remove pointless code and text in all files
		- Properly comment out code
