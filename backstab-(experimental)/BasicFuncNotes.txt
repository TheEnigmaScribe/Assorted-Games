To Do List

Continue working on entity spawning code, specifically enemies and nodes

	
FIXING FUNCTIONS
	
	Level initialization
		- Create function that initializes the tilemaps from textfile
		- Create function that spawns entities from the textfile (player, enemies, interactibles)
		- Create function that sets settings to the settings in the textfile
	
	- Reorganize spawning to create the enemy and assign their instructions at the same time
		- Enemy loading code will need to be redone
		- The intended format will consist of a list of points, and use AStar2D pathfinding
		- Each node may have its own set of instructions, or can be empty
		- The enemy will perform the instructions before continuing towards the next node
		- If a node is empty, the enemy automatically moves towards the next node
		- Format example: [S1] = []
	
NEW THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
	
	Sooner (important for function)
	- add pausing to game alongside a pause menu (solid buttons with semi-transparent background color)
	- basic campaign menu functionality
	- basic level selection menu functionality
	- saves (store data about what player has done and what level they're on)
	
	Later (function not dependent on it)
	- Audio settings page
	- Visuals setting page
	- Better visuals and basic animations
	- Basic audio and music
	
BUGS TO FIX
	
	- Fix minor input lag with movement keys based on comments under tilemap movement tutorial
	- Fix the bug of two entities being able to move into the same tile if moving at the same time
		- add either a bounce or player priority if a player and enemy move into the same space at the same time
		- automatic detection guaranteed one way or another
		- likely feaasible through somehow communicating to enemies what the target tile of the player is
		- and then comparing it with the target tile of the enemy
	
VISUAL/AUDIO
	
	-bullets in animation go through player?
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	- work on making saves (and possibly achievements)
	
	- get started on the textboxes (with sprites) after enemies can kill the player and the player can complete the level
	
	- basic sfx and music for game?
	
	FEATURES TO ADD
	
	MENUS
	
	- finish up menus
		- campaign menu
			- later save all following information to a file
			- start/continue button
				- if it's a new save (or possible on the Cell 82 scene? or its equivalent) have it display start
				- if it's not a new save, have it display continue
			- information
				- current level
				- how much time played
				- how many times you've died
				- how many times you've killed
			- managing save menu
				- delete/reset save file
					- are you sure? text
					- yes button
					- no button
				- back button
		- level selection (can't yet click and load a level')
		- settings
			- audio should eventually show sound settings
			- visuals should eventually show resolution fullscreen/not fullscreen settings and the like
			- controls should show control scheme and later allow for changing of keybinds
	
	- add actual "game over" functionality for enemies detecting the player
	
	- add player stab functionality
	
	- add player reaching goal functionality
	
	- add special functionality for goal depending on which way it's facing
		- ex: if it's on a wall to the player's left, have the player walk out left
	
CLEANUP?
	Remove pointless code and text in all files
	Properly comment out code
