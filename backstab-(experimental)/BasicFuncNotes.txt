To Do List
	- clean up formatting with classes and some naming stuff
	- properly comment out code later
	- possible load tilemaps with text files since I'm loading entities and enemy instructions that way already
	- Implement actual "game over" functionality for enemies
	- add player stab functionality
	- Create enemy movement function
	- Implement enemy turning/movement code
	- game menus
	- level selection
