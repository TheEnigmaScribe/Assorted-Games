Possibly make all movement on a timer? Should try Crypt of the Necrodancer to get a feel of how
REALLY thinking about that...

Guards have a set "patrol" path, but have AI to go off and investigate if they "hear" or otherwise indirectly detect the player?
would return to patrols aftewards if they didn't find the player

- textboxes and sprites for showing characters?
- enemy sight indicators that don't outright show area mostly
	- red laser line for snipers
	- area of light around guards 
		- (in the dark areas like if they have a lamp, or maybe just a bit lighter around them like the knight in hollow knight) 
		- (could just vary from map to map with lightlevel)
		- (prison really should have proper visibility around the shadow creature though...) 
		- (the prison is really dark overall)
	- brightened areas through telescopes for watchers?
	- trackers have same area as guards, but can track once they have a "trace" 
		- (or maybe they just always have a trace? or get one if you leave one, or just at some point midway)
- "Hearing" if you're close to the guard but not within sight range?
- "feeling" if you're right next to a guard?
