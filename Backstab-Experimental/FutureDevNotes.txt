Future ideas for development

could be interesting to make the grid hexagonal

Sounds like a good change
- Guards being able to "hear" the player when they walk onto a tile with a noisemaking interactible
	- would interrupt regular patrol sequence, possibly can get guards moving back to their patrol after
	- Would go to check it out, and if the player is not spotted, would return to their patrol
- Alarm phase (mixes up behavior)
	- Triggered by dashing past a guard
	- Changes behaviors of all guards on map (to be better or worse for the player)
	- Guards that saw the player can get a vague sense of where the player is?
- Sightline indicators (absolutely needed)
	- Snipers have a red laser indicator
	- Guards/Captains/Trackers have areas of light around them?
	- Watchers have brightened circles or ovals of vision on ground
- Player abilities (sounds really good)
	- Dashing (move in one direction until hitting a wall)
		- Prevents dying to a guard if dashing past one, instead activates alert
- Guards interacting with each other in various ways

Unsure if it's cool (unsure on a change)
- Possibly make all movement on a timer? Should try Crypt of the Necrodancer to get a feel of how
	- REALLY thinking about that...
- Special idling actions that might affect game? ideas listed below:
	- like guards talking on their radios
	- two guards chatting? if I can somehow manage that with the whole patrol thing
		- maybe if there's some guards that aren't on patrol but idling out of bounds
	- screwing off, like falling asleep or not paying attention?
		- if so, dashing by could mean that the guards only wake up but don't activate the alarm
		- could generally add behaviors as a method of making tight/impossible paths easier/possible
		

Uneccessary? (idea might be excessive)
- Being able to "overhear" guards chatting during chatting action



Can potentially just outright stop doing their patrol?
Possibly different personalities or behaviors for enemies?
	
Map editor eventually, to make levelmaking more streamlined?
Reorganize code with classes?

- textboxes and sprites for showing characters?
- enemy sight indicators that don't outright show area mostly
	- red laser line for snipers
	- area of light around guards 
		- (in the dark areas like if they have a lamp, or maybe just a bit lighter around them like the knight in hollow knight) 
		- (could just vary from map to map with lightlevel)
		- (prison really should have proper visibility around the shadow creature though...) 
		- (the prison is really dark overall)
	- brightened areas through telescopes for watchers?
	- trackers have same area as guards, but can track once they have a "trace" 
		- (or maybe they just always have a trace? or get one if you leave one, or just at some point midway)
- vents? able to go between two points, possibly have guards notice the noise
- dashing and other abilities

glass walls
always able to see through them
sometimes breakable by player and/or enemy
